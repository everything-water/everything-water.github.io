I am a water guy.

In my research, I try to understand the variability and changes in the water cycle at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and apply such understanding to water resources management.

Here I share my discoveries and thoughts about everything related to the water cycle, as well as my personal musing as a scientist.

Two month before staring my PhD, I became a father (it’s actually like another PhD, one that never ends). And in my third year I had another child---my third PhD. Once in a while I’ll share some anecdotes on this special journey too.

I hope that this blog will be informative for people who want to learn about the water cycle, or about life in academia.
